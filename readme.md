# Maakplek Moneybird Connector
This connector connects a Google Form (through Zapier) with Moneybird to create automated (onetime & recurring) invoices for new members. For an example form, see http://goo.gl/forms/7b4Ff09Vsz.

Just fill out the subdomain, username, password and the tax rate ID's (these can be found in your Moneybird account) and hook up the Zap from Zapier to the URL where you've put this script.
